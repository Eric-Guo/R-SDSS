Declarative vs Imperative
========================================================
![Declarative vs Imperative](imperative-vs-declarative.png)



Imperative programming style (R)
========================================================
Imperative languages are often restricted to a level of detail that is good for their compilers rather than for their programmers (Sokolowski 1991).

```r
numbers <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
doubles <- c()

for(x in numbers) {
  doubles <- append(doubles, x*2)
}
doubles
```
```
[1]  2  4  6  8 10
```



Declarative programming style (R)
========================================================
declarative programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.

```r
numbers<-c(1,2,3,4,5)
doubles=sapply(numbers, function(x) x*2)
doubles
```
```
[1]  2  4  6  8 10
```


Declarative programming style (Ruby)
========================================================
More favorite programming syntax in declarative style is functional

```ruby
ruby 2.0.0p247 [i386-mingw32]

c:\git>irb
irb(main):001:0> (1..5).map {|x| x*2}
```
```
=> [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```


Functional programming (Scala)
========================================================
Functional programming has type and also have speed.

```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.2 (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.7.0_40).
scala> 1 to 5
res0: collection.immutable.Range = Range(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

scala> { x:Int => x * 2 }
res1: Int => Int = <function1>
```

And it's keystone for parallel in muti-core era.

```scala
scala> 1 to 5 map { _ * 2 }
res2: collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[Int] = Vector(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)

scala> (1 to 5).par map { x => x * 2 }
res3: collection.parallel.immutable.ParSeq[Int] = ParVector(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
```


Getting SQL data in R (adv)
========================================================

```r
library(ROracle)
con <- dbConnect(dbDriver("Oracle"), username="sql_training", password="sq1trn", dbname="SPMSTST")
sql_statement <- dbSendQuery(con, "
SELECT *
FROM dogs t
")
fetch(sql_statement, n=-1)
```
```
     NAME OWNER_ID
1    Fido        1
2     Bob        1
3 A Huang        2
4    Wolf       NA
```


Define function to query data in SQL (adv)
========================================================

```r
sql = function(sql_text) {
  fetch(dbSendQuery(con,sql_text), n= -1)
}
sql("select * from owners t")
```
```
  ID OWNER
1  1  Eric
2  2 Alick
3  3 Cindy
```



Functional paradigms in SQL & R
========================================================

```r
sql("SELECT *
     FROM dogs
     INNER JOIN owners on owner_id=id")
```
```
     NAME OWNER_ID ID OWNER
1     Bob        1  1  Eric
2    Fido        1  1  Eric
3 A Huang        2  2 Alick
```

```r
dogs <- dbReadTable(con, "DOGS")
owners <- dbReadTable(con, "OWNERS")
merge(x=dogs, y=owners, by.x="OWNER_ID", by.y="ID")
```

```
  OWNER_ID    NAME OWNER
1        1    Fido  Eric
2        1     Bob  Eric
3        2 A Huang Alick
```


Compare with Imperative Programming
========================================================
```javascript
var dogsWithOwners = []
var dog, owner

for(var di=0; di < dogs.length; di++) {
  dog = dogs[di]

  for(var oi=0; oi < owners.length; oi++) {
    owner = owners[oi]

    if (owner && dog.owner_id == owner.id) {
      dogsWithOwners.push({
        dog: dog,
        owner: owner
      })
    }
  }}
}
```



INNER JOINS in SQL & R
========================================================
```r
sql("SELECT * FROM dogs
     INNER JOIN owners on owner_id=id")
```
```
     NAME OWNER_ID ID OWNER
1     Bob        1  1  Eric
2    Fido        1  1  Eric
3 A Huang        2  2 Alick
```

```r
merge(x=dogs, y=owners, by.x="OWNER_ID", by.y="ID")
```
```
  OWNER_ID    NAME OWNER
1        1    Fido  Eric
2        1     Bob  Eric
3        2 A Huang Alick
```

2  Eric                2
3 Cindy                0
```


SQL GROUP BY, R aggregate
========================================================
```r
merge(x=dogs, y=owners, by.x="OWNER_ID", by.y="ID", all.y = TRUE) -> od;od
```
```
  OWNER_ID    NAME OWNER
1        1    Fido  Eric
2        1     Bob  Eric
3        2 A Huang Alick
4        3    <NA> Cindy
```

```r
aggregate(od$NAME, by=list(DogOwner=od$OWNER),
  FUN=function(x) sum(!is.na(x)))
```
```

FROM dogs RIGHT OUTER JOIN owners on owner_id=id
GROUP BY owners.OWNER
HAVING COUNT(dogs.NAME) > 1")
```
```
  OWNER COUNT(DOGS.NAME)

  FUN=function(x) sum(!is.na(x))) -> oda; oda$x > 1
```
```
[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE
```

```r
oda[oda$x>1,]
```
```
  DogOwner x
3     Eric 2
```



SQL JOIN with subquery, R same function
========================================================
- Too much declarative feature will make you learning curve unnecessary long
- Too much imperative will make you working time unnecessary long
- Too much object will lead combine exploration
- Too much functional will leadâ€¦
  - No harmful [AFAIK](http://netforbeginners.about.com/od/a/f/What-Is-AFAIK.htm) at present, because itâ€™s just math
  - Hard to learn/express or not [scable](http://techsingular.net/?p=2300).


Formal SQL syntax
========================================================
```sql
SELECT [DISTINCT] columns | * | expression
  FROM table
ORDER BY sort_column1 [ASC | DESC],
         sort_column2 [ASC | DESC],
         ...
         sort_columnN [ASC | DESC];
[UNION ALL|MINUS|INTERSECT]
[SELECT clauses...]
```



Exercise/Demo Question
========================================================
- Which dog have no owner?
- Who have no dog?
- Who have at least one dog?
- List the dogs name whose owner have at least two dog..


Exercise/Demo Question 1
========================================================
- Which dog have no owner?

```sql
select * from DOGS t
WHERE t.owner_id IS NULL
```

```r
dogs[!is.na(dogs$OWNER_ID),]
```


Exercise/Demo Question 2
========================================================
- Who have no dog?

```sql
select * from OWNERS t
WHERE t.id NOT IN
  (SELECT owner_id FROM dogs)
# why wrong?
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM owners t
MINUS
select * from OWNERS t
WHERE t.id IN
  (SELECT owner_id FROM dogs)
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM dogs d
RIGHT JOIN owners o ON o.id=d.owner_id
WHERE d.owner_id IS NULL
```


Exercise/Demo Question 3
========================================================
- Who have at least one dog?

```sql
SELECT *
FROM owners o
WHERE o.id IN (
  SELECT owner_id FROM dogs
  WHERE owner_id IS NOT NULL
  )
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM dogs d
INNER JOIN owners o ON o.id=d.owner_id
```


Exercise/Demo Question 4
========================================================
- List the dogs name whose owner have at least two dog.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM dogs o
WHERE o.owner_id IN (
  SELECT t.id
  FROM (
     SELECT o.id, count(d.name)
     FROM dogs d
     INNER JOIN owners o ON o.id=d.owner_id
     HAVING count(d.name) = 2
     GROUP BY o.id
     ) t
  )
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM dogs o
WHERE o.owner_id IN (
   SELECT o.id
   FROM dogs d
   INNER JOIN owners o ON o.id=d.owner_id
   HAVING count(d.name) = 2
   GROUP BY o.id
)
```



Summary of SQL and R
========================================================
- Both functional, next **big** programming paradigms
- Think in (from recommend to not prefer)
  - Whole (let other people do the job)
  - Set
  - Functional
  - Step (combine function)
  - Imperative in detail
- SQL is much more used than R, but learning R will make you a better SQL writer
